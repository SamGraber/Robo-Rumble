Robo Rumble
============

An online turn-based strategy game. Players build robots and program them to win contests.

We are planning to build on the MEAN (Mongo DB,  ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) stack.

## Dependencies
### NodeJS
Go here: http://nodejs.org/

Follow the installation instructions.

You may need to add node to your PATH environment variable. Try running "node" from your root directory in command prompt and see if you get an instructions list or a "No such command" error. 

### MongoDB
For local development you will need to install MongoDB.

Go here to install on Windows: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

For other operating systems, the links are on the top left.

We will be using a hosted instance of MongoDB for production, probably MongoLab

### Other
Currently all other dependencies will be resolved through npm and bower.

After installing node, clone the git repository and then run "npm install" in the base directory followed by "bower install." This will install all of the other dependencies.
