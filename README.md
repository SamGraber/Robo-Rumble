Robo Rumble
============

An online turn-based strategy game. Players build robots and program them to win contests.

We are planning to build on the MEAN (Mongo DB,  ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) stack.

## Dependencies
### NodeJS
Go here: http://nodejs.org/

Follow the installation instructions.

### MongoDB
For local development you will need to install MongoDB.

Go here to install on Windows: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

We will be using a hosted instance of MongoDB for production, probably MongoLab
